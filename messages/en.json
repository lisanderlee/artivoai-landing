                "question": "What are credits?",
                "answer": "Credits are a measure of computational resources used to generate images or videos. They represent the processing power, memory, and time required for each creation. Different tasks consume varying amounts of credits based on their complexity and output quality. For example, generating a high-resolution image or a longer video will use more credits than a smaller image or shorter video."
            },
            {
                "question": "Can I roll over unused credits to the following month?",
                "answer": "Credits do not accumulate or carry over between billing cycles. At the start of each month, your compute unit balance is reset to your plan’s allocated amount, regardless of any unused units from the previous month. This ensures a fresh start and consistent resource availability for all users each month."
            },
            {
                "question": "What options do I have if I exceed my compute unit limit?",
                "answer": "If you exceed your compute unit limit, you have several options to continue your work:\n1. Upgrade to a higher-tier subscription with increased credits.\n2. Purchase additional credits to complement your current plan.\n3. Utilize your daily free credits, which automatically refresh each day."
            },
            {
                "question": "How can I get additional credits?",
                "answer": "Additional credits are available on the compute packs page to users with a subscription. These supplementary units serve as a backup, activating only when your plan’s allocated units are depleted. Once purchased, they remain available for use within 90 days."
            },
            {
                "question": "How can I monitor my remaining credits?",
                "answer": "To monitor your compute unit usage, click your profile picture in the top-right corner to view a quick summary. For a more detailed breakdown, visit your account usage page, where you can track your consumption over time and manage your resources effectively."
            },
            {
                "question": "Is it possible to modify my subscription plan?",
                "answer": "Yes! You can easily modify your subscription plan at any time. Simply navigate to your account page, where you’ll find options to manage and adjust your current plan to better suit your needs."
            },
            {
